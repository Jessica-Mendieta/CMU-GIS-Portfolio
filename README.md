# About Me

I'm a born and raised New Yorker who loves exploring the city and working on ways to make equitable policies through local government or nonprofits. As someone who attended public institutions through undergrad I learned that there are many gaps in access to resources that are exarcebated by some of the policies in place. To learn more about quantittative methods in public policy analysis I enrolled at Heinz College in Carnegie Mellon University to earn my Master's in Public Policy. It's exciting to know there are many people who want to work to address these issues and I met many of them at Heinz College. My coursework at Heinz was enhanced by a GIS class I took during my second semester, which prepared me for an internship at the NYC Mayor's Office of Resiliency, which helped me learn more about my city and apply the skills from my classes - it was a very fulfilling experience. 

When I'm not busy with school and work I enjoy going on runs and working on my reading list, but usually I'm just rewatching my favorites comedies (Parks and Rec is my all-time favorite) or anime series. 

# What I Hope to Learn

More mapping techniques and tools to explore my policy interests, especially around housing and education, as well as timely issues stemming from the COVID-19 crisis. There have been many tools introduced for mapping but data visualization concepts are what determines whether the audience understands your point. One of my goals is to combine best practices from mapping data and visualization and build good habits going forward. Another things I want to learn is using the sites available to us as students and have a foundation for a portfolio before graduating.
