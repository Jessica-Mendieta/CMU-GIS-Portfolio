# About Me

I'm a born and raised New Yorker who loves exploring the city and working on strategies to implement equitable policies. As someone who attended public institutions I saw the gaps in access to resources that exarcebate structural inequality. To learn more about quantitative methods in public policy analysis I enrolled at Heinz College in Carnegie Mellon University to earn my Master's in Public Policy. It's exciting to know there are many people who want to work in public service and I met many of them at Heinz. My coursework was enhanced by a GIS class I took during my second semester, which prepared me for an internship at the NYC Mayor's Office of Resiliency, and that experience helped me learn more about my city and apply the skills from my other classes - it was a very fulfilling experience. 

When I'm not busy with school and work I enjoy going on runs and working on my reading list, but usually I'm just rewatching my favorites comedies (Parks and Rec is my all-time favorite) or anime series. 

# What I Hope to Learn

More mapping techniques and tools to explore my policy interests, especially around housing and education, as well as timely issues stemming from the COVID-19 crisis. There have been many tools introduced for mapping but data visualization concepts are what determines whether the audience understands your point. One of my goals is to combine best practices from mapping and visualization to build good habits going forward. Another thing I want from the course is the foundation for a portfolio.

## Sheet Mapper Tutorial

###### Assignment Description and Products

I completed the [Mapbox Sheet Mapper tutorial](https://www.mapbox.com/impact-tools/sheet-mapper/) to show businesses in the districts of NYC Councilmemmber Carlina Rivera and NYS Assemblymember Yuh-Line Niou based on whether they have senior shopping hours, are a bike shop or small business. This information came from their Twitter feed between April 1 and 8 and is listed on a Google spreadsheet. To customize the code and create the website I used the Glitch app.
